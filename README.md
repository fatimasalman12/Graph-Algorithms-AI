Problem
<br>
<p>Implement Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), Iterative Deepening Search (IDS) and Uniform
Cost Search (UCS) algorithms to solve the 8-puzzle problem. The 8-puzzle consists of a 3x3 grid with 8 numbered
tiles and one blank space. The goal is to rearrange the tiles to form a particular configuration. Your program
should accept the initial configuration of the puzzle as input and output the steps required to reach the goal state.
In addition, compare the efficiency of the four algorithms in terms of number of nodes visited, path cost,
memory consumed, and time taken to find the solution. Report this comparison in a form of a table in a separate
word file.</p>
